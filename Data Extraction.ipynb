trillion to achieve the<br>            Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. The private<br>            sector plays a key role in mobilizing resources for<br>            sustainable solutions and building greater resilience. To<br>            date, limited attention has been given to how the private<br>            sector’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk<br>            management practices can contribute to the realization of<br>            universal goals, such as the SDGs.

Since the onset\n","      of the pandemic, the World Bank has provided $14.2 billion to over 100 countries to\n","      support their health responses. We also help countries finance and build stronger,\n","      more resilient health systems, including more than $30 billion to strengthen primary\n","      care and public health. We invest in regional programs, such as the Africa Centers for\n","      Disease Control and Prevention, to better detect diseases, expand laboratory capac-\n","      ities, and pool resources. Through the Pandemic Fund, which is housed at the World\n","      Bank, we finance projects that address critical gaps and strengthen pandemic pre-\n","      vention, preparedness, and response in developing countries (see more on page 47).\n","          Nearly half the world’s extreme poor live in countries affected by fragility, con-\n","      flict, and violence, and the spillover effects place all countries at risk.

Since IDA16, average annual IDA financing for fragile and conflict-af-\n","      fected countries has increased more than fivefold; and the share of IBRD’s portfolio\n","      in these countries nearly doubled from fiscal years 2016 to 2021. To address forced\n","      displacement, we help countries support refugees, internally displaced people, and\n","      host communities through concessional financing, social protection programs, and\n","      economic development (see more on page 49).\n","          Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the World Bank Group has\n","      leveraged our broad range of financing instruments to rapidly disburse funds while\n","      also mobilizing financing and support from donor partners. We have mobilized more\n","      than $37.5 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine by providing platforms for\n","      generous support from donors and international partners to supplement our own\n","      resources. This financing helps the government meet urgent budget needs, support\n","      essential public services, and address critical recovery and repair needs. By the\n","      end of fiscal 2023, we had disbursed nearly $23 billion. This support has reached\n","      13 million Ukrainians, helping provide wages for essential employees, pensions for\n","      the elderly, and social programs for the vulnerable (see more on page 31).\n","          A mounting debt crisis is making it harder for countries to confront these chal-\n","      lenges.

This trend\n","      has been further exacerbated by rising interest rates, depreciating currencies, and\n","      slowing global growth.

But despite\n","progress, women and girls in Western and Central Africa have a 58 percent chance\n","of not being enrolled in secondary school and a 20 percent chance of bearing chil-\n","dren as a teenager. Regardless of the sector in which they work, they can expect to\n","earn less than men.\n","    The World Bank Group is helping countries across the region empower women\n","and girls and promote gender equality. This means working to address the norms,\n","attitudes, and beliefs that hold back women and girls and promoting their access to\n","education and quality jobs. In Burkina Faso, we are supporting the Sahel Women’s\n","Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project, which is transforming the habits\n","of married men and helping increase the use of contraceptives, decrease violence\n","against children and women, and enable women to become more involved in house-\n","hold decisions. In Nigeria, through the Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and\n","Empowerment program, we are improving education access and quality to address\n","the constraints that girls face and ensure that they complete secondary education.\n","Launched in 2014, the Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program sup-\n","ports higher skills-development and research in science, technology, engineering,\n","and mathematics, particularly among women; these are fields that tend to be male\n","dominated, especially in Africa. But across the continent, the program is attract-\n","ing more and more female students for whom “science has no gender.” Currently,\n","about 35 percent of students enrolled in the program across Africa are women.\n","    Our work with countries to advance gender equality is showing strong results.\n","According to the World Bank’s most recent Women, Business, and the Law report,\n","Gabon and Côte d’Ivoire were among the top reformers in Sub-Saharan Africa,\n","increasing their index scores from 82.5 to 95 and from 83.1 to 95, respectively.\n","Gabon reached 100 on pay by mandating equal remuneration for work of equal\n","value and eliminating all restrictions on women’s employment; women in Gabon\n","can now work in industrial jobs and in jobs deemed dangerous in the same way as\n","men. Côte d’Ivoire reached 100 on entrepreneurship by prohibiting discrimination\n","in access to credit.\n","    These advances are fostering more inclusive development by addressing the\n","legal reforms, institutional barriers, and social norms that prevent women and\n","girls from fully participating in society. They are helping close gaps in earnings and\n","economic opportunity, reduce gender-based violence, and afford women and girls’\n","voice and agency.

But the undamaged\n","trees and forests that remain help temper the damage by absorbing the carbon—\n","effectively acting as a sink to drain carbon from the air. Indonesia wants to make its\n","forests a net carbon sink by 2030 by fostering forest and land use practices that\n","absorb more carbon than is emitted. This objective is part of Indonesia’s efforts to\n","reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32 percent—or as much as 43 percent with\n","international assistance—by 2030. In addition to reducing emissions, sustainable\n","forest management activities can also improve communities’ livelihoods.\n","    The Bank has supported Indonesia’s transition toward low-carbon, resilient, bio-\n","diverse, and prosperous landscapes since 2016 through the Sustainable Landscape\n","Management Program, which has yielded four important lessons. First, strong gov-\n","ernment leadership is essential, particularly at the local level. Second, decentral-\n","ized forest management is key to balancing protection with local economic activity.\n","Third, land-tenure security for local communities and Indigenous peoples is criti-\n","cal for forest protection and livelihoods. Fourth, solutions should be tailored to the\n","different challenges across land uses.\n","    We promote sustainable livelihood opportunities in Indonesia through the\n","Second Forest Investment Program, which has reached over 110,000 people—\n","nearly a third of them women and 15 percent from Indigenous communities—help-\n","ing them develop skills in sustainable forest management. Through this program,\n","we are also protecting forests while preserving sources of income for Indigenous\n","communities. One example is the rehabilitation of a natural pool within the Man-\n","dala traditional forest as a tourist destination, which helped increase the number of\n","visitors by 50 percent and contribute to the local economy.\n","    The program has strengthened local forest management and established part-\n","nerships with communities as well as 95 forest farmer groups. It has provided partic-\n","ipants—30 percent of them women or girls and 15 percent of them from Indigenous\n","communities—with access to online training and support for agroforestry develop-\n","ment, helping them better implement sustainable forest management.\n","    We are also helping Indigenous peoples and local communities achieve legal\n","access to land, positioning them as central to decision-making about the man-\n","agement of their regions and choices about their sustainable livelihoods. This has\n","helped accelerate recognition of over 2 million hectares of customary land and over\n","180,000 hectares of customary forest areas in 51 communities.\n","\n","\n","\t                                                                      THE REGIONS \t     27\n","\f      Europe and Central Asia\n","\n","\n","      C\n","                ountries in Europe and Central Asia are facing unprecedented shocks and\n","                uncertainty.

The war has unraveled 15 years of progress on\n","reducing poverty, pushing 7.1 million more Ukrainians into poverty (living on less\n","than $6.85 a day) and displacing 13.5 million people. The country’s GDP is projected\n","to grow by only 0.5 percent in 2023, after contracting by 30 percent in 2022.\n","    The World Bank Group has leveraged our broad range of financing instruments\n","to rapidly disburse funds. We have expanded existing projects, established multi­\n","donor trust funds, and channeled guarantees and parallel financing from donor\n","countries. Since the start of the invasion, we have mobilized more than $37.5 billion\n","in emergency financing by providing platforms for generous support from donors\n","and international partners that have supplemented our own resources to help the\n","government meet urgent budget needs and support essential public services—\n","about half of all economic assistance mobilized for Ukraine. We had disbursed nearly\n","$23 billion by the end of the fiscal 2023.\n","    This support has reached 10 million pensioners, 500,000 education staff,\n","145,000 government employees, 56,000 first responders, and more than 3 mil-\n","lion internally displaced persons and recipients of social assistance. The Bank has\n","deployed a range of mechanisms—including expenditure verification, beneficiary-\n","complaint monitoring, procedure reviews, and surveys—to ensure that money goes\n","where it is intended.\n","    We are helping restore access to essential health services, administering 2 million\n","doses of childhood vaccinations and providing more than 500,000 people with free\n","or low-cost medicines. Nearly 70,000 people accessed critical rehabilitation services\n","to address both mental and physical trauma, while 2,300 physicians were trained on\n","how to address gender-based violence, which has escalated during the war.\n","    In March, the World Bank released the updated Rapid Damage and Needs\n","Assessment for Ukraine, which emphasized the need for both public and private\n","funds to address an estimated $411 billion in reconstruction and recovery costs over\n","the next 10 years. The highest estimated needs are in transport, housing, energy,\n","social protection and livelihoods, explosive-hazard management, and agriculture.\n","To support recovery and build capacity for reconstruction, the Bank devised an\n","innovative “framework” project approach to disburse funds quickly and be scal-\n","able as more financing becomes available. Through this approach, we are helping\n","Ukraine strengthen primary health care and address greater demand for mental\n","health and rehabilitation services due to the war.\n","    Our energy project is helping repair the country’s electricity transmission and\n","heating infrastructure—half of which was damaged this past winter—by urgently\n","procuring critical equipment. We are also helping Ukraine restore its transport\n","network—which was disrupted in more than 21,000 villages, 51 towns, and 35\n","cities—by repairing bridges and railways to relink communities, support immedi-\n","ate humanitarian relief and recovery, and increase capacity of import and export\n","corridors. These projects are supported by the Bank’s Ukraine Relief, Recovery,\n","Reconstruction, and Reform Trust Fund, which channels and leverages grant contri-\n","butions from donor partners.\n","    In addition to our investments, we provide advice on policies and reforms and\n","structuring viable projects, all of which can mobilize private capital to help Ukraine\n","on its path to a sustainable future.

In September 2022, then-President David Malpass and members\n","     of the Task Force on Workplace Culture—established by the president\n","     in November 2021—shared their initial recommendations on enhancing\n","     managerial accountability and reducing the fear of retaliation. The rec-\n","     ommendations were shaped through sustained engagements with staff\n","     over several months.\n","         Since these recommendations were announced, the Bank Group\n","     has taken several actions. We established the Ethics and Internal Justice\n","     unit and selected a new vice president to lead it. We launched a review to\n","     create a modern grading structure that aligns with industry best prac-\n","     tices and enhances our ability to attract, motivate, and retain staff. We\n","     expanded our employment screening program to include criminal back-\n","     ground checks for all new short-term consultants.\n","         We continue to work on implementing the recommendations, includ-\n","     ing establishing the Disciplinary Advisory Panel and clarifying staff\n","     rules and whistleblower protections. Together, these actions build trust,\n","     empower, and motivate staff, and strengthen culture as a core value\n","     proposition.\n","\n","\n","\n","   To strengthen support for employees experiencing mental health conditions,\n","we launched a campaign to increase understanding, reduce stigma, and encourage\n","people to seek help early. We also delivered stronger medical plans this year that\n","enhance access to mental health services for all staff and their families, with special\n","emphasis on country offices, given the shortage of mental health professionals in\n","some locations.\n","\n","Addressing racism and racial discrimination. Since June 2020, the Anti-Racism\n","Task Force has delivered recommendations to senior leadership to address racism\n","and racial discrimination within the Bank Group, our operations, and the commu-\n","nities we serve. In its first phase, the Task Force submitted ideas on issues within\n","the workplace, which were endorsed by management for implementation. In Phase\n","Two, the Task Force focused externally, looking at race in our operations, corporate\n","procurement, community engagement, and the composition of our country offices\n","and staff around the world. The recommendations from this phase were submit-\n","ted to the Bank Group President and senior leadership in March 2023 for review\n","and endorsement for implementation. This marked the fulfilment of the Task Force\n","mandate, and the working groups were disbanded.\n","    During early 2023, vice presidents across the Bank Group hosted townhalls for\n","the Task Force secretariat to present and discuss the anti-racism work, engage with\n","staff, and keep up the momentum around the effort, building on previous internal\n","engagements and those with external organizations. This was capped by an all-staff\n","townhall with the President, members of senior leadership, and the Staff Associa-\n","tion in March 2023.\n","    The Task Force also worked to raise awareness around race and encourage con-\n","versations and activities across the organization. The Task Force developed and\n","shared resource guides and other tools to support staff in these efforts and offer\n","practical information and guidance. It also prepared and shared an infographic\n","based on data that look at the composition of staff by regional nationality, includ-\n","ing recruitment, promotions, and our global footprint.

It has focused its efforts\n","      on promoting transparency around the outcomes of its reviews of misconduct\n","      and conducts in-depth reviews of high-risk or recurring cases to help close gaps in\n","      controls. The department’s Anti-Harassment Coordinator addresses allegations of\n","      sexual and other forms of harassment. In fiscal 2023, the Anti-Harassment Coor-\n","      dinator received 278 cases; along with other institutional stakeholders, they also\n","      implemented supportive measures, such as post-resolution monitoring to ensure a\n","      safe working environment for survivors of sexual harassment.\n","\n","      Representing staff voice.

They are highly\n","vulnerable to external shocks, such as economic volatility, natural disasters, and\n","climate change, due to the small size of their economies, remoteness, and capacity\n","constraints. They suffer from annual disaster-related losses that average roughly\n","5 percent of GDP. Several small states experienced double-digit inflation in 2022,\n","resulting in financial tightening and higher international borrowing costs. Many\n","face exacerbated debt vulnerabilities. As most small states are net food and fuel\n","importers, persistently high prices contribute to deteriorating external accounts\n","and adverse social impacts, especially in countries with relatively high poverty rates.\n","    We have scaled up IDA and IBRD resources to help small states combat these\n","crises. During fiscal 2021–22 (IDA19), the Bank provided an average of $1.5 bil-\n","lion per year to small states, which was 66 percent higher than the average annual\n","support provided during fiscal 2018–20 (IDA18). In fiscal 2023, financing to small\n","states totaled $0.6 billion ($0.5 billion under IDA and $0.1 billion under IBRD). This\n","is aligned with the levels in the first year of IDA18, the last regular non-condensed\n","IDA cycle. The January 2023 edition of the Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report\n","also includes a special focus on the challenges facing small states.\n","    The Bank houses the Small States Secretariat, which hosts the high-level Small\n","States Forum annually on the sidelines of the World Bank Group–IMF Annual Meet-\n","ings, as well as a Small States Information Session on the margins of the World\n","Bank Group–IMF Spring Meetings. At the last information session in April 2023, the\n","discussions focused on how small states could better respond to crises and build\n","resilience to shocks. The forum remains an important platform for small states to\n","foster partnerships, advocate for their needs, and facilitate knowledge exchange in\n","tackling their unique challenges.\n","\n","\n","    For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/smallstates.\n","\n","\n","\n","Budgeting amid an unprecedented confluence of crises\n","In fiscal 2023, the Bank responded at record pace and scale to help countries\n","address multiple, overlapping, and compounding crises and increasingly complex\n","development challenges.
